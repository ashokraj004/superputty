#summary SuperPutty Introduction

# Introduction #
SuperPutty is a Windows application used primarily as a window manager for the PuTTY SSH Client. It allows you to embed PuTTY terminal instances inside of a windows form providing a better tabbed interface when multiple connections are used.

SuperPutty does not do any ssh or terminal management itself since PuTTY does an excellent job of this.
